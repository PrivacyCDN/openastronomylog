# Welcome to OpenAstronomyLog

## Goal
**OpenAstronomyLog** is a free and open XML schema definition for all kinds of astronomical observations. 
Software that supports this schema enables an observer to share observations with other observers or move observations 
among software products.

## History
The schema (formerly known as COMAST schema) was primarily developed by the 
german ["Fachgruppe f√ºr Computerastronomie"](http://www.vds-astro.de/fachgruppen/computerastronomie.html) (section for computerastronomy) which is a subsection of Germany's largest
astronomy union, [VDS](http://www.vds-astro.de/) (Vereinigung der Sternfreunde e.V.) 
Starting with version 2.0 the schema was renamed from COMAST (abbr. for *Com*puter *Ast*ronomy) to **OpenAstronomyLog**, or **\<OAL\>**.

## Documentation
Please see our [wiki section](https://github.com/openastronomylog/openastronomylog/wiki) as well as the [doc](https://github.com/openastronomylog/openastronomylog/tree/master/doc) folder

## License
The schema is released under the [APACHE Software License 2.0](https://github.com/openastronomylog/openastronomylog/blob/master/LICENSE) and is currently supported in both open source and 
commercial software. Just [download the schema archive](https://github.com/openastronomylog/openastronomylog/blob/master/OAL21.zip?raw=true)!
